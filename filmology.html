            Wealthy Felix is married to Grace of the outstanding gorgeousness. To Grace, the matrimony is not a commitment but just only a road to her needs and benefits. She loves the Mercedes Benz.  She is more in love with shopping, good looks and anything trendy better than him especially her favorite label, Prada. She is so prepared to spend every penny Felix makes even with Daisy’s (Grace’s best friend) confrontations. Daisy too has alot more in common with her friend including changing boyfriends like nothing and now having a new one Jessie she is replacing with David who is taking her on Holiday to Mombasa.  When Felix announces that he has been diagnosed with liver cancer which has metastasized, he’s told that he could die if he doesn’t get enough or early treatment and Grace is a little not surprised even for the fact that he is going to die. Comes in Felix’s doctor; capable John, who has away-out for him through chemotherapy but it’s risky and very expensive that Grace won’t allow all the money to go just like that however important it might be for Felix. She has a lot to spend the money to like looking after herself-say breast fragmentation for his husband’s happiness than his unreliable liver cancer which may kill him if not treated in the proper description. However expensive the treatment is, she partners with attractive Doctor John to help her husband in a way that not even Felix can ever imagine. Taking in on the treatment is risky for Felix and so is for Grace’s beauty to be skipped by John! Grace succeeds in luring Dr John to do the treatment. She finally not only likes Prada, but she adores Dr Felix and still has alot to save from her soon dying husband’s fortune.  </p>
